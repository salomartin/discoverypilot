I notice increasing reluctance on the part of [executives] to use judgment; they are coming to rely too much on research, and they use it as a drunkard uses a lamp post, for support rather than for illumination.

IMO the best product will stem from a very strong mental model of the domain and the users. UXR can help you *get* to such a model, and validate it along the way, but it's important to view the syllogism as UXR -> model -> product, not UXR -> product.

(I find games helpful as an example. You can't research your way straight to a good game—or so good game designers tell me. But you can use it to inform a model that eventually leads you to create a good game, and you must use research to test whether the game is actually good.)

That example resonates.

It also raises the question of how one can arrive at a model that is more likely to be the "correct" one (say in terms of meeting users' needs really well)

Is it mainly about Domain Expertise + User Empathy + Creativity?
