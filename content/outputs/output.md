Hey, it's Max! Thanks for chatting with me today. I'm currently researching how people think about their savings and shopping. To start off - do you invest your money anywhere currently? 

If you do invest, I'm curious about the why and how, from the last investment you made to the reasons why you chose it over traditional banking. 

Now, if you haven't ventured into investing as of yet, I'd love to hear what has stopped you so far, and what circumstances would spur you to consider it.

Shifting the focus a little - do you have any money lounging in accounts that earn less than 2% interest? If yes, I'm curious what's keeping it there versus putting it somewhere with higher returns?

Alright, now I've got an interesting scenario for you. Imagine that you could get your favorite subscription service like Netflix or Spotify, free forever, just by moving some of your bank deposits to a new NeverPay account. You can stop the free service any time and your principal is returned as well. What questions would prop up in your mind?

If you're finding the topic interesting, let's delve a bit deeper. If it worked in a way where you moved £2500 to a new NeverPay account, got free Netflix immediately, and in 12 months' time, you got your £2500 back and you could withdraw anytime if needed. What stands out to you about such a scenario? What elements make you feel concerned or excited?

Alright, I've noted down your thoughts concerning the NeverPay account, how we could make it more appealing, any trust-related points and the importance of being able to withdraw at one's own convenience.

While discussing these queries, feel free to express anything you think is important, as your unique concerns and perspective are invaluable to this research. Remember, this is a conversation and not a sales pitch! Your comfort in discussing your money habits and thoughts matters most here. 

Let's get back to your reactions about investing in general. Why might you hesitate to invest more? Is risk a concern? Or is it the complexity or the lack of a clear benefit? Maybe trust issues? 

Now, let's take a different angle. Does the thought of getting a shopping benefit motivate you to change your investing behavior? Do you feel the pinch of the cost of your subscriptions? Or maybe the appeal of freebies get you interested?

Lastly, I'm keen on understanding which factors might contribute to your decision making process for the hypothetical NeverPay account. Could you share what kind of deposit thresholds give you pause or comfort? How long, ideally, would you want to commit? And what gives you trust in a financial service?

Alright! This has been a great chat. Thanks for sharing. Next time you speak with me, Max, your AI assistant, I will share insights based from our discussion today. Please feel free to ask me anything about investing or any other topics you’re interested in!
