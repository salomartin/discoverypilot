Why should your target market be so narrow? Several reasons:

1. Focus: It’s hard enough to solve one big problem for one person.
2. Distribution: It’s easier to get people excited about your product if it feels like it’s made for them. It’s also easier to get in front of people with the same interests or problems.
3. Early adopters get your flywheel spinning: As Geoffrey Moore taught us over 30 years ago, most people aren’t early adopters. Instead, they wait for others to tell them a new product is worth their time. They wait for social proof. Early adopters, on the other hand, love new stuff. They’re less focused on pain points, and mostly just want to stay ahead. But once they get excited, they tell others. That’s how you cross the “chasm.”
