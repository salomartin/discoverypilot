* We have way to collect the money from consumers as a single transaction onto customer titled account  
  * Within that transaction, we can purchase the principal at a discount and wire rest to us as revenue  
  * From our revenue, we can  
    * Pay the merchant (directly, via gift card, via prepaid card)  
    * Pay for execution costs  
* We are able to receive the 2.5k transaction at a low cost, ie \< 1 gbp via open banking  
* We are able to get the KYC / Source of Funds done at a low cost \< 2 gbp via open banking  
* We are able to return the 2.5k in principal at a low cost (ie 10% of their 25k avg idle deposit)  
* We are able to get the “item” to consumer personal income tax free (ie without requiring consumers to update their tax returns)  
* We are able to get the customer to deposit 10x product/service purchase price (e.g. 2500 instead 250\) and have it locked in for an extended period of time (12m+) in order to get the service for free  
* We are able to create a simple blend of two separate complex flows \- purchase decision & investment decision  
  * Arguably, the perception of getting something “for free” could make certain purchase decisions easier (no-brainer) vs “do I want to spend the money”  
  * We are able to “retailize” complex investment decisions in a no-brainer way

* We allow people to withdraw in x days at cost  
  * Customer will be charged 15% of deposit (150% of item purchase price)  
* TBD Will customer purchase return trigger investment return? Or will there be a choice? Is there an assumption related to it?  
* For simplicity, investment can be made after product return period is lapsed (14d?)  
  * What happens with gift card & prepaid card
