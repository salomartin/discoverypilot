we are not testing returns from smartsaver
we are not testing whether they are willing to invest in smartsaver

we are testing whether in combination with shopping they would like to pay for returns

whats proof enough that shopping & investing is connected
	x out of y - willing to bet 5-10x for a period to unlock a product / subscription
	get x% to buy multiple times

we find or create an event or trigger or habit or need to tap into
	they can say what they subscribe to
		we can offer a selection - of netflix etc, as those are fixed, we can showcase the deals easily
	ask if theyre looking to buy anything / find deals & offer - or even a calculator is easier
		paste url / search - we make an offer
    what are the looking to buy?
        which of these would you like to get for free or cheaper
    what are they subscribed to?
        which of these would you like to get for free or cheaper
    when is that event?
    how do we trigger a need?

What are people most concerned about when someone offers them to invest & earn returns?

Do you invest or not?

If you don't invest, then why?

Do you know anyone with idle cash? Ie > 5k on current account, not earning interest?
    Why do you think they have it and are not investing it?

What would make them invest?

How much savings do they have? (ie earning > 2% interest)

How much idle cash do they have? (disting from savings, on current account, earning less than 2% interest)

How much are they willing to invest?

Would you share about investing with friends, family or community? Would you refer investment products to them?

What motivates you to invest?
What are the motivations behind not investing?

How frequently do you think about investing?

If you had the option to move your deposits to another bank to get services free (ie netflix, spotify, gym etc) would you do it?

Is it friction to get an offer with every purchase on how you could save on that purchase if you invested?


Tell us about the last thing you bought online? How much did you pay for it?
If you could get it for free or cheaper by depositing your idle cash elsewhere, would you do it? (ask it somehow in a story form -ie hypothetically in the context of neverpay product offer as if theyd be doing that?)
what concerns would you have about doing that?

Westendorp to assess investment return level? ie whats too good to be true, what's ok etc?

Is spending smart / saving smart a thing for you, ie buying stuff from investment returns? could it become something?
    * would you evaluate every purchase in that way?
    * are you looking for deals & value from merchants? or don't care and don't have time?

Is ability to withdraw / easy access any time a key aspect for you when investing even if it lowers returns?

Would oyu be willing to give access to your last 3 months transactions via open banking to get personalised investment offers that match your spending?

Are you aware that banks are robbing you with low interest? And that there's a high degree of idle cash? (leave this last not to bias?)


* What is minimum utility & value?
    * customer interviews with max help a bit here, but we should do our own
    * a small group of customers who love you is better than a large group who kind of like you. In other words, recruiting 10 customers who have a burning problem is much better than 1000 customers who have a passing annoyance.
        *  In a company’s earliest days, it is important to place more priority on d in order to ensure that you have product/market fit. It is useless to try to grow or scale before finding 100 users who really love your product. 
        * where can we find such early users with idle cash?
            * let’s get them & build together with them
    * what is the real customer problem?
        * look for a way in which you can accomplish 90% of what you want with only 10% of the work/effort/time
* Is there some segment we could serve & launch without all the regulation?
    * accredited investors?
    * companies?
    * to learn & test?
* Is there some value we could provide that’s related but is free and helps build userbase?
    * ie the financial freedom score
* How do we focus and do less & simple?
    * Customer first (merchant second)
    * What else could it be?
* Role of merchants?
    * In current plan - it’s about improving CAC & growth

* What is the key metric?
    * Usually, my answer to founder questions such as “how should I be spending my time?” is spectacularly simple. Choose a key metric to track and focus exclusively on making that metric grow. When deciding what to do, choose the activity that you believe will directly result in increased growth of your chosen metric.
