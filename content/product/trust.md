choose your own returns - ie x% discount on product

# Ideas
* Should show possibility of all the things you could get for free if you'd invest - visualize this at different investment levels. Ie for 500 GBP per year, you could get these products, for 1000 GBP per your those etc...
* Make high street banks the adversary - show how much you are losing if money is just sitting on a current account - it's earning money for them, not you. Take back control.
    * ie show you're losing items like these if x amount sitting on current account, not invested
    * if you invest, you get excess cash that is not going to be spent anymore, so your savings grow and you could spend on other things
    * appeal that if you have savings you’re letting it waste on current accounts - be smart
* Testimonials, social proof around how people are enjoying their new things
    * Testimonial also about how easy it was to withdraw if they needed the cash
* Show products, but also subscriptions, ie netflix for life
* Illustrate convenience of doing this, ie just a few steps
* Best deals from merchants - not only invest, but also save money
* Trustpilot
* GenAI
    *  images of people enjoying the products
    *  personalised story generated for you how you could live 
        * based on connected bank account
            * what you could buy
            * which daily products that you use you could get for free - we put a bundle of those together for you
            * which deals you could get from merchants
            * generate photos of all those things to illustrate
* Use the story formats
* Already try to gamify the experience - connect your account, see how you could live
    * ie show how some people at the top have bought xyz and what life they are living VS if they kept in high street
    * show how other similar people spend and on what - help you get great deals on that or surface new experiences 
    * Offer tests, ie what you could buy (ie connect with open banking) + this unlocks personalised deals and offers from merchants if you've connected your bank account
    * like a big 5 personality test (could be wealth test or savings test or something like that) - we could profile you as a potential investor somehow, ie people love to find out deeper insights about themselves - we could help them transform as well or improve - that's the levels
* Use podcast format like NotebookLM to generate podcast content to explain the content to people https://x.com/karpathy/status/1840112692910272898?s=46 
* Show how your monthly burn is going down and how much extra you have by end of year by not spending anymore
    * show where you rank vs other similar ones
