Interviewing

THE 4 TYPES OF PRODUCT-MARKET FIT
Product-Problem Fit (a suite of features that cohesively solve an important problem for a number of distinct customer segments)
Solution-Market Fit (a broad offering that is meaningfully differentiated across a large share of industries or segments that make up the overall market)
Feature-Problem Fit (a small feature-set that provides compelling value for an important use case)
Solution-Segment Fit (a broad offering of related products & services that meet the needs of a few selected segments very well)

How comprehensive is your product offering?
What is the variety of customer segments with fit?


George Bernard Shaw said: 

“The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place”

Possibly the most important communication lesson, ever.shreThis lesson also can also teach us why the art of good listening is so vital for communication

Listening is the only aspect of communication that is fully in our control

So if we want to ensure that communication actually takes place, listening is a great place for us to start

A thread with examples of good/bad listening and ideas for learning the art of listening:

Listening well is a rare superpower.

I had been a bad listener most of my life.

Then I fixed that a few years ago.

The result?

Night & day difference in my critical thinking & leadership ability.

For customer interviews, people create a list of questions & try to go through them during the call.

Instead, create a list of things you want to learn, prepare 3-4 prompts, and ask the right follow-up questions based on what they tell you. That’s how you discover the real gold.

A surprisingly large part of conceiving great products is recognizing the difference between

1) what users are asking for

2) what they want

3) what they really need

4) what they will enjoy
To make consistently successful products:

a) understand the differences between 1 through 4 above

b) allocate the right investment mix across them, specifically based on the product’s current context

c) pay timely attention to differentiation, monetization & quality
Many folks rightly pointed out this addition

5) what they will pay for

I wholeheartedly agree on that addition for B2B products & paid consumer products.

For a more general framing though, it'd be quite safe to include that under #3.

One reason most customer interviews kinda suck is that the interviewer goes into the customer conversation with a structured list of questions and his/her goal is essentially to go through that list of questions in 30 minutes & to diligently capture notes to share with the team.

Always Decompose

Practical steps:
1. Observe the thing
2. Get others' POV on it
3. Break it down to its elements
4. Name these elements
5. Make the names evocative
6. Assess current context
7. Ask which elements matter
8. Prioritize them
9. Go execute

Some user-focused companies reward PMs for collecting user feedback for years & years and yet their products don’t actually win in the market and yet their go-to solution to this problem is.... MOAR  USER 
 FEEDBACK!

These companies don’t understand that collecting feedback is the easiest, most mechanical part of the job here.

The alpha really comes from *translating that feedback to unique insights* and from *making creative choices* on
a) what problems to actually solve
b) what customers to prioritize
c) what features to build & not build
d) how the user experience works
e) how to market the product in a way that really resonates

In product reviews, these questions can reveal a lot about the team's rigor:

1) How critical is this problem for customers?

2) What alternatives did you consider & reject?

3) Do we have data that helps predict how users will react?

4) How are you going to get user adoption?

——
Why do most teams that understand their customers still fail at creating winning products?

They fail to translate that understanding into the right product.

Why?

Chiefly, because they make a long series of average choices.

They choose between 2 or 3 obvious options but remain oblivious to the other 10 options that were available to them, with just a little more thought & creativity.

Do this repeatedly, over the hundreds to thousands of choices that a product team ends up making, and you get an average product and pedestrian positioning of said product.

So what do they do next?

Talk to the customer. Talk more to the customer. Go on a customer listening tour. Fixate on the customer. Answer support tickets to build more empathy. etc. etc.

All good things, but none of these things will solve the real problem: inadequate creativity, which stems first from a lack of appreciation of the role of creativity in product work.

This is why most teams out there are forever stuck on the treadmill of “doing all the right things” but still not winning in the market.

The takeaway:
You need to understand that you cannot consistently build winning products in your career without translating customer insight into the exactly right product, UX, and positioning. And creativity will provide you the greatest alpha there. 

So, embrace the importance of creativity and thoughtfully inculcate it within your product team.

WAYRTTD is the first thinking tool I learned at Stripe.

It stands for “What Are You 𝙍𝙚𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 Trying To Do”

WAYRTTD is a trusted friend anytime I’m confused about a problem.

And at some point, the WAYRTTD approach becomes hardwired ⇒ faster clarity & greater effectiveness.

—
Strategy isn’t very complicated. Understand Porter’s 5 Forces, Porter’s 3 Generic Strategies and Helmer’s 7 Powers. Plus, deeply understand the domain in which your product operates. With this foundation, a smart team can derive everything else to craft a compelling strategy.
—
We don’t take the time to thoroughly understand the problem, domain, competitors & other determinants of product success because we feel compelled to be in constant motion. We tell ourselves we must begin building & just iterate based on feedback

We craft flawed product strategies & make suboptimal product decisions because we base these decisions on what we know we can easily execute today.

When we talk to customers about the problem that our product solves, we overestimate its severity & get surprised when the customer doesn’t end up buying or using our product. Any problem will feel more critical while you’re talking about it

The chief purpose of user research is to understand your users’ motivations.

The tactics & details are also useful, but you aren’t getting the full value of user research until you understand their motivations. And once you do, watch your team’s creativity skyrocket.

Your product’s marketing needs to answer these 3 questions:
1) What does it do?
2) How good is it?
3) Is it for me?

Envision where your target customers are going to first encounter your product. Make sure these questions are answered in those places.

The 3 most important questions to regularly ask about your product:

1) Is it serving an implicit or explicit user need very well?

2) Is it differentiated enough?

3) Is the market large-enough (or will it be) so you can meet your business goals?


Shortsightedness & Low Agency typically cause this fallacy.
	•	Qualitative inputs
	•	Quantitative summaries and metrics from them

Does this approach increase variety of inputs & research going into product dev?

Captur eemotional aspects that are hard to quantify directly

Talk to customers frequently

Develop and refine hypotheses continuously

Understand what isnt said

Check with customers - what are we getting wrong about the product 

Help reframe existing hypotheses and ideas from different perspectives, help ask the right questions even

Extract wisdom not just answers and data

Help identify what not to focus on, whats not really important

Input to great PRDs (chatprd input feeder)


Input to product strategy

Ask new questions super fast, shorten cycle time
		Explore — How long from idea to measured feedback? Larger companies tend to increase this delay as social structures become more complex, tolerance for risk declines, and extract thinking comes to dominate the culture. Delay creates a feedback loop: fewer experiments->fewer successes->more pressure on each experiment->fewer experiments.

1) More Product Thinking: You need to do more Product Thinking and less Project Thinking (see the image below if you’re curious about the differences between Product Thinking and Project Thinking)

2) New Opportunity Creation: You need to spend more time on creating new opportunities and the next big new business for your org & company (instead of being mainly focused on executing on and optimizing the current cash cow)

3) Actual Product Strategy: You need to clarify the vision and product strategy for your product (and make sure that the right people at the right levels in the right functions understand this vision & strategy, and are aligned to execute on it across the company)

Something I’ve observed over the years:

Product Managers who always win real-time debates about product issues — with their quips, eloquent arguments, bulletproof analogies & metaphors — tend to build surprisingly mediocre products, with mediocre outcomes.
Why?

This tendency of Gifted Great Debaters (GGD) has a few adverse effects:
- It falsely grows GGD's confidence about being right
- It shrinks GGD's team members’ self-confidence
- It can drain team members’ energy to a point that they often just choose not to speak up
How to deal with this if you're a GGD?

- Reframe the point of the product debate in your head. It isn’t to win. It isn’t even to get your arguments heard
- The point of a product debate is for you to seek counterarguments
- Ask questions rather than making definitive statements
How to deal with this when working with a GGD?

- Send GGD a link to this thread 

- Ask GGD to make a compelling case for the opposite of their stance. Create a norm that no decision can be made without that
- Get more time. Create some space between the debate & the decision
And perhaps the most important tactic of all:

Have fewer 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘣𝘢𝘭  discussions about important issues.

𝘞𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨  instead of 𝘛𝘢𝘭𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨.

Writing creates rigor.
——
Your customers’ feedback about what’s most painful & frustrating about your product is typically a lot more trustworthy than their take on what new features you should build.


——
A sensible null hypothesis for consumer products is that the user doesn't care about your product, doesn't have time to use it, doesn't understand its purpose, will skip any onboarding tutorials, won't read UI copy, will forget about it after signing up or installing it...

...won't invite others to use it, will use the password reset flow to sign in Every Single Time, would rather use TikTok or Instagram or YouTube or Netflix instead of your product, doesn’t know about the existence of that superb feature that took your team 2 years to build...

...will disallow push notifications, will ignore or unsubscribe from your marketing emails, will not upgrade to the paid version even if rationally it seems worth it, will let the subscription lapse, will readily switch to a shiny new competing product.
All that to say: consumer product management is fucking hard.
And we haven't even talked about the non-user side of it:
making sense of conflicting experiment results, mediating 100s of different opinions on what to build & how, tensions between scaling infra & building features, being at the mercy of platform gatekeepers, and on and on...
Thanks 
@shalmanese
 for asking the question about B2C product management in response to my tweet on the sensible null hypothesis for B2B product management.
Quote

A sensible null hypothesis for B2B products is that the customer doesn’t really need your product, will not pay for it, and will not deploy or use it.
What else should be included in the null hypothesis for consumer / B2C products? 

Share your thoughts and experiences below.
Oh, if it isn't clear, none of the aspects of the null hypothesis are the user's fault. Good consumer prod mgmt is about understanding that users have a lot going on and by default don't want to engage with your product. And it's the PM & team's job to deal with that reality.

——
1) Who is the customer?
2) What is the problem/opportunity?
3) What is the main customer benefit?
4) How do you know customers want this?
5) What is the customer experience?

Project Thinking is about understanding expectations, formulating plans, marshaling resources, and coordinating actions to meet those expectations.

Product Thinking is about understanding motivations, conceiving solutions, simulating their effects, and picking a path based on the effects you want to create.

# A Product Thinking Primer

1. **Suspend the Project Thinking Mindset**
   - Take your Project Thinking hat off. Put the Product Thinking hat on.

2. **Prioritize your real goals**
   - Ask _Why?_ and _So what?_ often. What effects do you want to create on your users?

3. **Understand your users' needs**
   - Pay particular attention to **objections & friction points**. Look for unexpressed needs.

4. **Generate options**
   - Don't be afraid of big ideas. Embrace creativity & differentiation.

5. **Simulate**
   - Visualize how each option will play out. Then repeat until you converge.
