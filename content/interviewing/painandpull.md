When talking to people, look for two things: pain and pull. Pain tells you there’s an opportunity to solve a problem. Pull tells you that you’re actually solving the problem.

Here’s what pain and pull look like in practice:
1. People pay you money: Several people start to (or offer to) pay for your early product, ideally people you don't have a direct connection to.
2. Strong emotion: You're hearing hatred for the incumbents (i.e. pain) or a deep and strong emotional reaction to your idea (i.e. pull).
3. Cold inbound interest: You're seeing cold inbound interest in your product.
4. Continued usage: If you've got a prototype running, people continue to use your product even if it's bad.
