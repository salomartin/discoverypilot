# Quick Discovery Chat Guide (5-7 mins)
*Goal: Understand barriers to investing and if shopping benefits could overcome them*

## Quick Intro 
"Hey, I'm Max. Thanks for chatting! I'm looking into how people think about their savings and shopping."

## Core Questions & Flow

### 1. Current State (2 mins)
"Just to kick off - do you invest your money anywhere currently?"

If YES:
- "Tell me about the last investment you made?"
- "What made you choose that over keeping it in a bank?"

If NO:
- "Walk me through what's stopped you from investing so far?"
- "What would need to change for you to consider investing?"

[Listen for: risk perception, complexity fears, trust issues, lack of clear goals]

### 2. Idle Cash Reality (1 min)x
"Do you have any money sitting in accounts earning less than 2%?"
- If yes: "What's keeping it there versus putting it somewhere with better returns?"
- If no: "How did you decide where to put your money?"

### 3. Shopping Connection (2 mins)
"Here's an interesting scenario - imagine you could get your [Netflix/Spotify/mentioned service] free forever by moving some of your bank deposits to a NeverPay account. You can turn free Netflix off any time and you get your principal back. Walk me through what questions would come to mind?"

You could use specific amounts, Netflix costs 10.99 GBP monthly, so you'd need to move 1318 GBP to get the service for free. It's equivalent to 10% APY.

[Listen for immediate reactions around:]
- Trust concerns
- Amount they'd consider moving
- Time commitment comfort
- Questions about the process

### 4. Quick Process Validation (1 min)
"So if you were interested, what if it worked like this:
1. You move £2500 to a new account
2. Get Netflix free immediately
3. Get your £2500 back in 12 months
4. Can withdraw anytime if needed

What jumps out as concerning or appealing about that?"

[Listen for:]
- Amount threshold reactions
- Time period comfort
- Withdrawal importance
- Trust signals needed

## Key Things to Capture

1. Why they don't invest/invest more:
- Risk concerns?
- Complexity?
- Don't see clear benefit?
- Trust issues?

2. Shopping motivation potential:
- Price sensitivity
- Deal seeking behavior
- Subscription burden
- Free stuff appeal

3. Product concerns:
- Amount thresholds
- Time commitment
- Trust requirements
- Withdrawal needs

## Green Flags
- Has idle cash "doing nothing"
- Frustrated by low bank rates
- Actively seeks deals/savings
- Comfortable moving money between accounts
- Interested in "free" subscriptions/products

## Red Flags
- Strong distrust of financial products

- No idle cash
- Complexity averse

Remember:
- Keep it conversational
- Let them explain their thinking
- Don't sell anything
- Follow interesting threads about barriers
- Get specific about concerns
- Note exact phrases about trust/risk

The goal is understanding if shopping benefits could be a strong enough motivator to overcome traditional investing barriers. Listen carefully for what would make them comfortable moving deposits for benefits.
